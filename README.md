# LinUtils
A slue of functions written in C for easy fileio, file manipulation and other things that involve files and the system.


# Does it work with Linux?
Yes, it was created in Linux. It should work for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

# Why single .h files?
The difference between 9 and 10 files is not that big. But the difference between 1 and 2 files is rather noticeable. 
Also, using single .h files makes it easier for people to use. Rather than importing a bunch of .c files and .h files, they can simply
include the .h file that they want, and they will be on their way.

This is by no means the right way of doing things, i am aware of that. If enough people want me to change it, it will.

# How do i use it?
Check out test.c to see an implementation example. Will be adding more comments to test.c as the code base gets a little larger.
